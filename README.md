# Choose Adventure - Fun
## Backend
- This is a simple application where I will test my skills in creating a server and database. Once the server is running and connected to my Heroku account I will store user information (username, password) along with fun items for the user to store in his or her backpack for their adventure. This will all be stored in my database. 
### Outcome
- This will show my ability for implementing full CRUD.
- Skills in querying correct data into a postgress application
- Ability to hit endpoints and follow data values
- Correct usage of user authentication, and controllers

## Frontend
- This will be the visual display to the user of the items stored in the backback. This will include a variety of pages to view and user profile information. Here the user will be able to login, and get into their account to see what they have earned and stored in their backpack. It will be styled and look professional.

### Outcome
- Show ability in handling data values from the backend and displaying them in the frontend
- Skills in proper styling (CSS)
- Correct usage of functional and class components that all use a variety of packages in order to LINK to other pages through hashRouter.
- Full skills in creating a full stack web application.
